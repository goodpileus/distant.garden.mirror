          Captured through a WhatsApp conversation conducted on their mobile phones, Saki Mafundikwa and Chino Amobi indulge in a rich conversation that is all at once casual and encyclopedic. Both graphic designers have a deep connection to the
          world of music and the visual arts. Their research and work draws on their African heritage and the dynamism of their lived experience as international multidisciplinary artists.
