        <div>Laurel is working on publishing an online anthology of writings about expressing love online. The project, colloquially titled "internet onion," was originally created in her "Interactive Design" class at Yale during the Spring 2019 semester. 17 students in the class responded to the following prompt:</div>
        <br>
        <div class="quote">In her piece "<a target="_blank" href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/fei-liu-a-drop-of-love-in-the-cloud/">A Drop of Love in the Cloud</a>," (2018) artist Fei Liu writes about the like/heart button as a flattening affordance of giving affirmation and love. The text-editor provides a much more expressive input. But even people who can't communicate well because of language barriers can express love through actions, like cooking food. Can we create other "love inputs" that might allow us to "reach across the chasm of a seamless signal"? What is expressing "real" love or affirmation about? Is it about effort, thoughtfulness, generosity, something else? What might a thoughtful or generous interface feel or behave like?</div>
