        <div class="quote">The “internet onion” is a <a href="https://the-life-and-death-of-an-internet-onion.com/">webzine anthology</a> that explores the possibility of love online. It started as a simple writing prompt with my interactive design class at Yale two springs ago—we started by wondering what thoughtful or generous interfaces might feel or behave like, and if there is any way to best send and receive love online, “reaching across the chasm of seamless signal” in any meaningful way.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="quote">Like love, onions absorb and magnify the time and energy you put in. Both have incredible healing properties, which we need now more than ever amid a global pandemic. Expressing love online is no longer a mere desire but a visceral need.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="quote">This project was begun as a seed two years ago, when I read artist Fei Liu’s <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/fei-liu-a-drop-of-love-in-the-cloud/">writing</a>, “A drop of love in the cloud.” One year ago, her words inspired a prompt for my class, and my students’ writings evolved into a web publication that we together compiled, edited, designed, illustrated, and developed. After a long time coming, it was published online with the help of Are.na.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="quote">Just so you know, this publication will eventually rot and die. It’s an onion, and the shelf life of a non-refrigerated onion is about 5 weeks. Thankfully, onions are perennial, and this one will return online around this time next year. “Who knows what will be going on then, what new things will arise to keep us apart, and what new inventive ways we’ll devise to stay together,” supposes Meg Miller in the onion’s final layer. The onion will live from July 23–August 27, 2020.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="quote">This project is the result of true teamwork, and I’m indebted to all contributors, each of whom had a unique role in bringing the onion to life (and death). Thanks to: Herdimas Anggara, Taichi Aritomo, Milo Bonacci, Jessica Flemming, Vicky Gebert, Tommy Huang, Harin Jung, Minhwan Kim, Monica Kim, Willis Kingery, David Knowles, Sunnie Liu, Julia Ma, Adam Moftah, Meg Miller, Mengyi Qian, Anna Sagström, Vlad Vykhodets, and Betty Wang.</div>

        <!-- <div class="quote">In her piece "<a target="_blank" href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/fei-liu-a-drop-of-love-in-the-cloud/">A Drop of Love in the Cloud</a>," (2018) artist Fei Liu writes about the like/heart button as a flattening affordance of giving affirmation and love. The text-editor provides a much more expressive input. But even people who can't communicate well because of language barriers can express love through actions, like cooking food. Can we create other "love inputs" that might allow us to "reach across the chasm of a seamless signal"? What is expressing "real" love or affirmation about? Is it about effort, thoughtfulness, generosity, something else? What might a thoughtful or generous interface feel or behave like?</div> -->
