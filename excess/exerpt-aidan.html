    The man is a legend, and is incredibly talented both as a singer, songwriter and band leader. He practices his band like James Brown – if a musician misses a note, he is fined... well almost! He gets a stern warning! The crazy thing is that he can't read music! So he mouths every musician's part, including the horns! I've watched him work and thought, "genius"!

    Well, since we're in Mali, I have to introduce you to my favorite female singer of all time: Rokia Traore. She plays a huge Rickenbacker guitar but it's her voice that has captivated me. Rokia is from a wealthy family – the father's a diplomat and she could have chosen another path, but she chose music – the traditional music of Mali. Her voice is bewitching, other worldly and angelic even but that omnipresent Malian sound is what gets you . A REAL treat for the soul.
    Check her out here with a traditional ensemble, and if you love Bob Marley check out her "Afrika Unite" at 6.30:

So, this wasn't a Top 20 of my favotite Afrikan album covers, that's Mission Impossible for Afrika. These are my favorites the ones I could find. There's a lot more from Afrika that's difficult to find. And the mixes, I don't have any. I stopped making mixes in the 90s and not easy to lay one's hands on mixes on the continent.

I think a good place to bring it full circle would be to ask you, in relation to Bob Marleys concert in Zimbabwe, what you think the future of African music and design will be like in relation to freedom and liberation

    Hello Saki and Chino, this has been an incredible engagement so far. We are hoping to wrap up the published part of this conversation for the sake of our process. At the end of tomorrow we will download the content and begin formatting. I am sure you can ge tot a great wrapping up point by then and already feels like you are naturally getting to that place. I hope your conversations will continue past this point too!
    <br><br>
    Very much looking forward to sharing this phenomenal content. It is encyclopedic!

    Oops, I always hit "Return" and it posts the message before I'm done! So let's try this again.<br><br>
    So, Bob Marley's lyrics brought hope to a battle-weary people who had endured a brutal and bloody six-year civil war. A lot of lives had been lost but in the end, People Power triumphed! Fast forward 40 years later, Zimbabwe is a failed state, destroyed by the scourge of CORRUPTION and GREED. Afrikan music has endured and at this very moment, Nigerian Pop is poised to take over the continent and hopefully, the world. Afrikan music will be alright, mostly because it is always willing to look outside and to allow those influences to seep into its DNA. Design too is on the move. Afrikan fashion has always been an influence on the global fashion scene. We've seen Afrikan models like Iman become megastars on the Fashion scene. Afrikan styles have been ripped off on the global Fashion scene but we're now seeing fashion designers from the continent making waves and strides internationally. Architecture is also at a good spot, as foreign trained Architects are returning home to change the scene at home. Afrika could become a mover and a shaker in that field. Graphic Design has been the last hold-out but with the recent formation of PADI – The Pan Afrikan Design Institute based in Ghana, all that might change. This is the first such initiative and if the numbers of designers (multidisciplinary) joining the initiative are anything to go by, then the future of DESIGN in Afrika is very bright indeed. I am at a place where I'm feeling quite hopeful.<br><br>
    All these hopeful feelings are marred by our leadership, though. Afrika's leaders continent wide are all guilty of the scourge of corruption and greed. It seems like people get into politics so that they can LOOT as much as possible for themselves, their families and cronies. This is one scourge that we have no idea how to handle. I ran ZIVA for twenty years without any funding, not from outside or from within. The government let me do my thing without any assistance and the outside world blamed the politics of my country for their refusal to help with funding. We all know that a school needs funding to grow. We were on our own for twenty years. If that ain't a miracle, then I don't know what that word means.<br><br>
    In conclusion, I think that it's the Pan Afrikan spirit that will grow music and design in Afrika. It seems like that spirit's gaining ground and traction and that gives me reason to smile. It's like the ARTISTS will liberate Afrika. The politicians brought political "independence" and that was a good thing, great even. "Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds..." That timeless message from the eternal Bob Marley is a good place to end this amazing conversation I've enjoyed and had the honor and joy to engage in with my young blood Chino! 👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿
