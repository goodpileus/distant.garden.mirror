		So, many years later, in the late 90s, my best friend, Ben is dating this woman and one day we all go out. I keep staring at her like, I know this woman. Finally, it clicks and I ask her, "Were you at the Fela reception way back in '86?' She
		thinks
		for a moment, then she says, "Yeah, I was there!" What are the chances!!! That's the kind of life I lead.

		He was an easy pick, but the rest of Afrika wasn't biting. Phaidon came to me because they wanted to give Afrika equal representation, but try as I did, I could not find any takers, just Lemi. His work made up for the lack of representation,
		though. He has done most of Fela's covers in his signature style and unique illustrations. I am happy to say that Lemi and I are close friends now.

		Dang..That’s flooring. All those moments. I can’t believe you met Fela! Especially around that time. Had to be electrifying. And getting to work with Lemi Ghariokwu. So cool. Phaidon is legendary.<br>
		I remember speaking to a musician friend named a year or so ago named Desire who is from South Africa. They make amazing music solo as well as in a duo called FAKA that is influenced by Gqom and traditional South African music amongst a million
		other things. I think they have popular appeal and we were talking about the possibility of an international African musician that could reach the status of notoriety on a global level as Fela or Miriam Makeba. Do you think that’s something that
		might happen in the near future?
